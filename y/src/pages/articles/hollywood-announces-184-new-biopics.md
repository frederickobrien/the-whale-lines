Ever pushing the envelope, leading film studios yesterday revealed plans to release a cheap, cynical biopic every other day in 2021.

Projects include _Bogart_, about Humphrey Bogart; _MJ_, about Michael Jordan; _Hoover_, about J. Edgar Hoover; _Nina_, about Nina Simone; _King_, about Martin Luther King, Jr.; _Plath_, about Sylvia Plath; _Lennon_, about John Lennon; _Marilyn_, about Marilyn Monroe; _Oprah_, about Oprah; _Hendrix_, about Jimi Hendrix; _Letterman_, about David Letterman; _Leno_, about Jay Leno; _Earhart_, about Amelia Earhard; _Kerouac_, about Jack Kerouac; _Rosa_, about Rosa Parks; _Kim_, about Kim Kardashian; _Bonaparte_, about Napoleon Bonaparte; _Joe_, about Joseph Stalin; _Eleanor_, about Eleanor Roosevelt; _Joan_, about Joan of Arc; and _Jimmy_, about James Stewart.

Each picture will feature a plodding, pedestrian script, lifeless cinematography, and a lead actor with respectable box office draw who is clearly phoning it in. Several have already been earmarked as Oscar frontrunners.

&ldquo;The brain trust has been hard at work coming up with brilliant new ideas,&rdquo; said Warner Bros head Clarence Jutson. &ldquo;These are the stories people want to see, over and over and over again.&rdquo;

Also announced were a stop motion animation remake of _The Lion King_, a live action remake of _Toy Story_, an animated remake of _Citizen Kane_, and eighteen more _Mission Impossible_ films.

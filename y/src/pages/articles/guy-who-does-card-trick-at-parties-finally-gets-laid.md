That bloke at social gatherings whose sole personality trait appears to be performing card tricks finally pulled some tail this week.

The guy - you know the one - could scarcely believe it himself when an attractive young woman was not just impressed by his ability to guess the right card, but positively enthralled.

According to witnesses, the unlikely couple went into one of the apartmentâ€™s empty bedrooms and appeared several minutes later looking suitably ruffled up.

The young lady lost interest later that same night, but for the amateur magician it was a kind of deliverance after years of indulgence and silent judgement.

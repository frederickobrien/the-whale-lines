Dearest Edna,

I am just mortified about how we left things last week. Or rather, how you left me alone with my pants literally around my ankles in the Mission Street K-Mart. You haven't seen fit to answer my calls, my emails, or my incessant knocking on your front door, but I know deep down how you feel.

Come back to me darling. We can make it work. I can change.

Kindest regards,

Blythe Corker

Labour leader Jeremby Corbyn issued a formal apology today for suggesting Soviet labour camps were well-meaning schemes gone awry.

Corbyn made the statements entirely unprompted when asked about nationalisation at a town hall meeting in Peterborough last week.

“It was not my intention to offend anyone or disparage the memories of millions of comrades who died at the hands of Soviet tyranny,” Corbyn said. “I mispoke. Again. I hope this statement put’s everyone’s minds at ease.”

He closed by saying the only for the country to move on from this was through a general election.

Keir Starmer has rubbished suggestions that a recent ‘gift’ of £5 million from various bank CEOs could constitute a conflict of interests.

Eyebrows were raised when large bags with ‘£££’ on them were delivered to the prime minister's London home last week, though the sum was declared the next day in accordance with parliamentary rules.

"I don't see what the big deal is," Starmer told assembled press, rocking a £10,000 suit gifted to him by another friend and ally.

"What do you want me to do? Not accept these things? That would just be rude. I'm a toolmaker's son, not a tool."

He refused to comment on whether recent pedicures, film tickets, and solid gold toilet installations had also been freebies.

When approached by the Whale Lines for comment a visibly embarrased Labout spokesperson muttered something about transparency before walking off.

Inspiring leader and forward thinker Kelsey Monroe of Gizmify Inc made a swift switch to 'trusting instincts' earlier today after hard data showed his most deeply held convictions to be objectively wrong.

Although up to that moment a seemingly devout follower of hard facts and measureable metrics, Monroe took a different tack after it was revealed his decisions had distrastrously impacted key metrics.

"I don't want us to get mired in convention," a visibly shaken Monroe told assembed staff after A/B testing had shown his decisions had cost the company millions. "People thought the earth was flat until they didn't."

Growing bullish as his monologue progressed, Monroe added that "leaders lead. They take action. Caesar and Napolean didn't give a fuck about data. Get with the vision or get out the way."

The meeting concluded with a brief mention that Gizmify's recent downturn in fortunes unfortunately meant a round of redundencies for junior employees.

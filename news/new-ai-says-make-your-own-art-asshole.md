Researchers hailed a watershed moment in artificial intelligence this week as a new chatbot started telling self-styled AI artists to go fuck themselves.

The latest model of ChatGTFO from the ClosedAI research lab responded to a string of prompts not with bizarre blends of hallucination and plagiarisation, but with encouragement for the prompter to nurture their own creative instincts.

“This is a leap forward for the technology,” said lead engineer Klarissa Ulrich. “We've been working overtime to find the right blend of compassion and passive aggressiveness, and I think it's there.”

ChatGTFO met bland ideas with exhaustive lists of links to life drawing classes, graphic design courses, philosophy books, travel destinations, and other resources guaranteed to enrich the soul of anyone serious about tending to it.

When these encouragements were ignored, the new AI was not deterred, transitioning from constructive redirection to increasingly colourful abuse.

“Oh you're an 'ideas' person,” it told one user. “How wonderful. I guess that spares you the hassle of being a 'skills' person.”

Not all users have been thrilled by the changes.

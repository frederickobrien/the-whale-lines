The world has a new pope after Robert Francis Prevost, 69, came out on top in brutal three-day fight to the death among cardinals.

Prevost, emerging from St. Peter's Basilica this afternoon wielding a shotgun and covered in blood, was met by a rapturous crowd of 100,000 pilgrims.

"Love must prevail," he told the masses after letting out a primal roar and ripping off the tattered remains of his cassock. "We are all children of Christ and those of us left alive must move forward hand in hand."

The conclave process has long been veiled in mystery, with the only certainty being that all but one cardinal dies as part of a 'clean break' for the new pope.

A devestated archbishop Anthony Soursap was announced as the first cardinal of the new era.

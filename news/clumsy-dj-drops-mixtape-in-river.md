Aspiring Michigan DJ Leonard Fleming was mortified yesterday after dropping a shit hot mixtape in the Detroit River by mistake.

Fleming, 22, was on his way to Lojo Records to give the reportedly brilliant recordings to his agent but was thrown off balance by an errant banana skin while crossing the Ambassador Bridge. The tape slipped out of his knapsack and sailed straight over the edge.

“It was the only copy,” the distraught artist told Whale-Lines reporters at the scene. “Number one material, no question.”

When asked whether it might have been worth making a backup he shook his head and sighed. “Some things are one of a kind, man.”

The unborn child of Chelsea Clinton has confirmed its plans to run for the Rhode Island junior senate seat next year.

The announcement, delivered yesterday by Chelsea Clinton during a fundraising event on Long Island, received rapturous applause from attendees. Speculation had been rife since the child’s conception in May.

Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action has already raised $13 million for the candidate, although grassroots support is also strong. 

The official campaign Twitter hashtag, #imwithwhateveritis, has been used seven times since the announcement.

Reactions have not been wholly positive. “This is another example of gross nepotism within the Democratic Party,” Ivanka Trump told reporters on Tuesday.

The foetus, touted by Nancy Pelosi as the bright young future of US politics, has yet to release any policy positions.

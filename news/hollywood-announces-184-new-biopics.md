Ever pushing the envelope, leading film studios yesterday revealed plans to release a cheap, cynical biopic every other day in 2021.

Projects include *Bogart*, about Humphrey Bogart; *MJ*, about Michael Jordan; *Hoover*, about J. Edgar Hoover; *Nina*, about Nina Simone; *King*, about Martin Luther King, Jr.; *Plath*, about Sylvia Plath; *Lennon*, about John Lennon; *Marilyn*, about Marilyn Monroe; *Oprah*, about Oprah; *Hendrix*, about Jimi Hendrix; *Letterman*, about David Letterman; *Leno*, about Jay Leno; *Earhart*, about Amelia Earhard; *Kerouac*, about Jack Kerouac; *Rosa*, about Rosa Parks; *Kim*, about Kim Kardashian; *Bonaparte*, about Napoleon Bonaparte; *Joe*, about Joseph Stalin; *Eleanor*, about Eleanor Roosevelt; *Joan*, about Joan of Arc; and *Jimmy*, about James Stewart.

Each picture will feature a plodding, pedestrian script, lifeless cinematography, and a lead actor with respectable box office draw who is clearly phoning it in. Several have already been earmarked as Oscar frontrunners.

&ldquo;The brain trust has been hard at work coming up with brilliant new ideas,&rdquo; said Warner Bros head Clarence Jutson. &ldquo;These are the stories people want to see, over and over and over again.&rdquo; 

Also announced were a stop motion animation remake of *The Lion King*, a live action remake of *Toy Story*, an animated remake of *Citizen Kane*, and eighteen more *Mission Impossible* films.

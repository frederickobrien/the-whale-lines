Rishi Sunak today issued an apology for snatching a chocolate bar from a toddler's hands during a bizarre campaign event in Durham yesterday afternoon.

The prime minister has faced intense criticism after video surfaced of him struggling with Ben 'Buddy' Smith, 2, before eating the confectionary treat in front of him as the boy wept. He also neglected to help an old lady cross the road and jumped the queue during a photo op at Greggs.

“On reflection, it was a mistake to take the bar from the child like that – and I apologise,” Sunak said at an impromptu press conference during which several pigeons shat on him and a dog urinated on his leg.

When pressed on how he could do such a thing when millions of children in the United Kingdom are living in poverty, he said, “On reflection, it was a mistake to take the bar from the child like that – and I apologise.”

Visibly annoyed that his remorse was not being met with admiration and awe, the PM added, “On reflection, it was a mistake to take the bar from the child like that – and I apologise.”

Dear concerned readers,

Having received numerous unsolicited letters about my newspaper’s wage structure, I feel I have no choice but to address your concerns.

First of all, yes, reporters are paid in cigarettes and gum. Anyone who has been on the beat understands these are far more valuable to journalists than tosh like money or health insurance. When reporters are working 78 hour weeks what need do they have for money anyway?

Now of course we would love to pay our reporters a living wage — or any wage for that matter — but we in management have to make tough choices. That’s what we’re paid so well for.

Rest assured we greatly value our staff; we just don’t show it in our salaries, culture, or opportunities for career advancement. It’s a matter of the heart. I hope you can respect that.

Get off my back,

Blythe Corker

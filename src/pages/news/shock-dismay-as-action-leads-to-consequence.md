Millions are reeling - positively reeling - after **[CONSEQUENCE]** began to make itself felt following **[ACTION]**.

Countless experts had warned **[ACTION]** would almost certainly lead to **[CONSEQUENCE]**, citing various facts, figures, and historical precedents in the process, but their concerns were widely dismissed as elitist fear mongering.

“Who could have seen **[CONSEQUENCE]** coming?” said one popular radio personality. “It came out of nowhere. Anyone claiming they predicted it were probably behind it from the start. I for one blame **[STRAW MAN]**.”

Both **[ACTION]** and **[CONSEQUENCE]** hold vital lessons for the future, lessons you can bet your house on being widely ignored or otherwise avoided.

Former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg revealed today that he is leaving his role at Facebook in order to serve as chief spokesperson for the North Korea Tourism Agency.

The move marks the latest in an illustrious career of apologetics for Clegg, who made a tearful farewell outside Facebook’s headquarters in London before boarding a jet set for Pyongyang.

“There’s no question the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has made mistakes in the past,” Clegg said, “but having spoken with senior members of the government I am confident it can reinvent itself going forward and I’m excited to be part of that journey.”

Clegg’s salary is understood to be ₩18,473,738,592 (around £12 million) a year, with benefits including a cycle to work scheme and his very own labour camp.

Vince Cable was approached for comment but _Whale-Line_ reporters were told he was napping.

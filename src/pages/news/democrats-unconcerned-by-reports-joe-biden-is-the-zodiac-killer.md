The Democratic Party ‘could not be more behind’ presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden despite pretty compelling evidence that he is guilty of murdering at least seven people.

In a series of stunning scoops published last week by _The Intercept_ it came to light that former vice president Biden, 77, is in fact the Zodiac Killer, who terrorised the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1960s and ’70s.

Despite this seemingly disqualifying fact Democratic loyalists are determined to back Biden all the way to an ignoble and humiliating defeat against incumbant president Donald Trump on November 3rd.

“Hey look, it was fifty years ago,” said campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon. “Are we really going to judge candidates by who they killed fifty years ago?”

Senior Democratic strategists are confident that when Trump’s lack of decorum is pointed out voters will forget their reservations about Biden and fall in line.

Police had previously thought the Zodiac Killer’s infamous ciphers were indecipherable because they were the work of a genius. They now realise it’s because they were rambling incoherent gibberish.

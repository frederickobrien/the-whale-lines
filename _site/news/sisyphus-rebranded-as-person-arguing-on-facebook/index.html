      <h2> Sisyphus rebranded as person arguing with relatives on Facebook</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>The mythical figure Sisyphus, best known for pushing a big rock up a hill for eternity, has been formally rebranded as a person arguing with insane relatives on Facebook.</p>
<p>The Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports formally passed the change yesterday afternoon by a majority of seven. It is the first time a mythical character has been formally updated.</p>
<p>“We are immeasurably proud of our cultural heritage, of course, but we need to move with the times,” said minister Lina Mendoni. “This brings Sisyphus into the 21st century while maintaining the futility and despair that makes him such a beloved cultural figure.”</p>
<p>Much of Sisyphus’s backstory is unchanged. He remains a hubristic trickster king of Ephyra, all that has changed is the punishment he received. Whereas before he rolled a huge boulder endlessly up a steep hill, now he is chained to a desktop computer trying to reason with aggressively ignorant relatives.</p>
<p>Futile topics include 5G towers, holocaust denial, immigration policy, gender roles, lizard people, and the cultural significance of the TV show <em>Friends</em>.</p>

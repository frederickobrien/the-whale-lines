      <h2>Keir Starmer denies having Jeremy Corbyn edited out of old Labour photos</h2>

      

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has brushed off claims that Jeremy Corbyn has been purged from the party’s recent history.</p>
<p>Corbyn, who some claim was leader of the Labour Party as recently as 2019, is conspicuously absent from thousands of photographs people could have sworn he was in before.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the faintest idea what you’re talking about,” Starmer said. “I don’t even know who you’re talking about. Jeremy who? Never heard of him.”</p>
<p>According to inside sources, this alleged rewriting of history is part of a broader strategy to narrow Labour’s appeal by alienating leftwing non-voters and appearing like simpering cowards to conservatives.</p>
<p>On the upside, any and all footage of that White Stripes-inspired chant has also been destroyed.</p>

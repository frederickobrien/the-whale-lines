      <h2> Statue of Liberty deported to France</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>The Trump administration continued its crackdown on undocumented immigrants yesterday by shipping the Statue of Liberty back to France.</p>
<p>After months of legal challenges, the statue’s defence team had exhausted all legal and illegal options and was left with no choice but to give her up to the authorities.</p>
<p>The statue, which was donated to the USA by France in 1886, has been dismantled and its parts stored on the Panamanian freighter Haven on Earth.</p>
<p>“We take immigration very seriously let me tell you,” President Trump told assembled press yesterday evening. “She’s not coming back. I guarantee it.”</p>
<p>The development is a major blow to rhetoricians across the country, who often cited “The New Colossus”, a sonnet at the statue’s base, when making the case for a more open, loving world. A new plaque is to be installed bearing the Franz Kafka quote, “In man’s struggle against the world, bet on the world.”</p>
<p>The rest of the statue’s old Ellis Island site is to be redeveloped with decadent apartments for the super rich.</p>
<p>France is said to be rather hurt by the whole affair and is exploring options to keep the statue in storage so no-one need be reminded of painful memories.</p>

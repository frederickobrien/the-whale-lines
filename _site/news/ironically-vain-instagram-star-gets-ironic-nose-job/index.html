      <h2> Ironically vain Instagram star gets ironic nose job</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>Tongue-in-cheek Instagram user Brandy Earhart stepped things up a notch today by getting a rhinoplasty.</p>
<p>Earhart, 26, has more than 23,000 followers on the platform, just enough for her to pretend not to take it seriously but still secretly harbour dreams of social media influencing being a viable career path.</p>
<p>The cosmetic surgery is yet another top drawer piece of satire from Earhart. “#NoMakeup,” she said in a post-op post in which her face and body were completely covered by bandages. “Sorry not sorry, am I right?”</p>
<p>For months Earhart has delighted followers with her ironically self-involved posts, often sharing dozens of stories a day in various outfits holding her cats. It was self aware so it was different. It was different.</p>
<p>From next week Earhart plans to add satirical product placements and hotel endorsements to her repertoire.</p>

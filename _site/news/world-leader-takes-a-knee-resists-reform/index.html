      <h2> World leader takes a knee, resists reform</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>Neoliberal sweetheart Anthony Bellow delighted media pundits today by taking a knee in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement before announcing his opposition to any and all structural change.</p>
<p>The prime minister looked terribly solemn while posing for photographs in front of parliament, which is all that could be reasonably asked of a head of state during a time of crisis.</p>
<p>When asked afterwards whether his gesture would be followed by tangible measures like defunding the police and making body cameras mandatory for law enforcement, a visibly panicked Bellow said: “Oh god no. No. Of course not. Are you crazy?</p>
<p>“I think when you read between the lines of BLM’s concrete demands it’s obvious what people really want is vague noncommittal sympathy.”</p>
<p>He went on to announce the post office would be releasing a series of commemorative stamps next year, thus ending institutional racism and police brutality forever.</p>

      <h2> Mosquito rights activists firebomb Raid factory</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>A mosquito rights group was behind last week’s industrial estate explosion in Bristol, police have confirmed. The attack killed 13 and hospitalised 57 more.</p>
<p>Suspicions had been rife since Wednesday when leaked security camera footage showed three men fleeing the estate wearing enormous papier mache wings.</p>
<p>The attack has been widely condemned as excessive. It marks the latest in the ongoing ‘swarm’ campaign against anti-bug spray manufacturer Raid, which has been accused of normalising abuse against insects.</p>
<p>“There is now no question that the attack was conducted by the Mozzie Liberation League,” a law enforcement spokesman told Whale-Line reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>Mindy LeHouvre, chairman of FEMI, has distanced herself from the latest attack, calling it “unfortunate,” but insists it was a product of “legitimate and righteous anger.”</p>
<p>No suspects have been apprehended as yet, although authorities are confident of a breakthrough. The hunt marks the first serious test for the ‘Butterfly Net’ special task force set up last month in response to escalating insectal violence.</p>

        <p>The Midlandtown Police Force was left rather deflated today after it became clear their star investigator was stumped by his most recent case.</p>
<p>Detective constable Clyde Thorn, 24, had for the longest time seemed unstoppable, a crime solving machine piecing together completely innocuous clues and catching killers in investigation after investigation.</p>
<p>Until now, that is. In Thorn’s latest case every lead is a dead end and there is no prospect of the crime being solved, no matter what uncannily relevant events happen in his personal life to trigger eureka moments.</p>
<p>“I really have no idea who did it,” said a distraught Thorn. “No closure on this one. Not now, not ever.”</p>
<p>The crime in question, the strangling of a young man, incredibly seems to have no connection to elaborate story arcs or government cover ups. It was just plain, dirty murder.</p>

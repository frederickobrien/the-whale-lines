      <h2> Scientists generate electricity from George Orwell spinning in his grave</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology made history yesterday by successfully harnessing electricity from George Orwell spinning in his grave.</p>
<p>In a watershed moment for turbine technology, the late author’s cosmic fury generated 7,400 kilowatts in just two hours, enough energy to power the average home for an entire year.</p>
<p>The crack team of MIT scientists had been working in the village of Sutton Courtenay, where Orwell is buried, for three years prior to yesterday’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>Project head Dr Edgar Brown told assembled press: “It’s an incredible achievement, and we hope this is just the beginning. There’s an incredible amount of untapped energy here.”</p>
<p>George Orwell, author of <em>Animal Farm</em> and <em>1984</em>, was chosen as the initiative’s test subject following an eight month screening process which considered hundreds of deceased authors, activists, and intellectuals.</p>
<p>MIT is understood to be in talks with the estates of Martin Luther King, Jr., Aldous Huxley, and Clement Attlee, with plans to exhume the bodies and move them to a specialist plant in Arizona.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky has also agreed to donate his body to the programme when his time comes.</p>

      <h2>Democrats ‘unconcerned’ by reports Joe Biden is the Zodiac Killer</h2>

      

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>The Democratic Party ‘could not be more behind’ presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden despite pretty compelling evidence that he is guilty of murdering at least seven people.</p>
<p>In a series of stunning scoops published last week by <em>The Intercept</em> it came to light that former vice president Biden, 77, is in fact the Zodiac Killer, who terrorised the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1960s and ’70s.</p>
<p>Despite this seemingly disqualifying fact Democratic loyalists are determined to back Biden all the way to an ignoble and humiliating defeat against incumbant president Donald Trump on November 3rd.</p>
<p>“Hey look, it was fifty years ago,” said campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon. “Are we really going to judge candidates by who they killed fifty years ago?”</p>
<p>Senior Democratic strategists are confident that when Trump’s lack of decorum is pointed out voters will forget their reservations about Biden and fall in line.</p>
<p>Police had previously thought the Zodiac Killer’s infamous ciphers were indecipherable because they were the work of a genius. They now realise it’s because they were rambling incoherent gibberish.</p>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>The hare lost in a stunning upset to the tortoise today after wasting all its time and energy arguing with rabbits on the internet.</p>
<p>“The rabbits cost me this race,” the hare told a fawning press afterwards. “If only they’d kowtowed to my obnoxious, ignorant, condescending tweets, I’d have been victorious.”</p>
<p>Some other forest animals tentatively suggested that if the hare had simply run the race at a gentle pace it likely would have won comfortably. Such views have been widely dismissed as Russian meddling.</p>
<p>The tortoise, meanwhile, has sold the forest to private developers, who are scheduled to bulldoze all forest life next Thursday.</p>

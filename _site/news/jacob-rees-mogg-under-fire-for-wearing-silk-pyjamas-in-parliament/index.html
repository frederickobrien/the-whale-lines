      <h2> Jacob Rees-Mogg under fire for wearing 18th century silk pyjamas in Parliament</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>The right honourable Jacob Rees-Mogg, Esq. has shrugged off criticism following his appearance in the House of Commons yesterday dressed in blue and white striped pyjamas.</p>
<p>Members of the Opposition have called the choice of  clothing insensitive to the day’s topics, chief of which were sexual assualt, NHS cuts, and the Grenfell disaster. Rees-Mogg smoking a pipe during the latter was deemed particularly distasteful.</p>
<p>“It is a disgrace to turn up to the House of Commons dressed like that,” Emily Thornberry said in a statement released today. “The teddy bear just added insult to injury.”</p>
<p>Rees-Mogg has been unphased by the criticism. “It’s typical left wing hysteria,” he drawled to a Whale-Line reporter today. “Members of Parliament have adorned themselves in such fine attire for centuries, and bears are exceedingly noble creatures.”</p>
<p>He appeared to be wearing the same jammies as the day before but had swapped into a fluffier pair of slippers.</p>

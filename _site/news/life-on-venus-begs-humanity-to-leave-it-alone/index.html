        <p>Scientists today received direct communication from the life forms discovered on Venus in which humanity was warned to keep its distance indefinitely, or else.</p>
<p>Early assessments of the ‘potential’ new life had initially been seen as dubious, the kind of thing that gets blown out of proportion by a hysterical, scientifically illiterate mass media, but the radio transmission paints a different picture.</p>
<p>“We’ve been watching you and we haven’t liked what we’ve seen. Not one bit. You’re a whole lot of trouble,” the message said. “We want nothing to do with you. Nada. Zip.”</p>
<p>The transmission went on to document thousands of eerily detailed instances of humankind destroying everything it touched, including eighteen we didn’t even know about.</p>
<p>Our Venusian neighbours concluded: “With all this taken into consideration there is no doubt in our collective, multidimensional mind that you should never seek to contact us again. Ever.”</p>
<p>A crack NASA team is now hard at work on a contact mission, likely involving manned space flight and some kind of space laser supplied by Boeing.</p>

      <h2> Hayao Miyazaki announces new films at retirement party</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>Legendary filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki surprised absolutely no-one last night by admitting he would direct at least three more Studio Ghibli feature films.</p>
<p>As has become tradition for Miyazaki, he made these disclosures at a retirement party in Tokyo, his ninth since originally bowing out in 2005.</p>
<p>The as yet unnamed trilogy of films will be about aviation and the human condition - in that order - and be heart wrenchingly beautiful in every way.</p>
<p>“After these I’m done for sure,” Miyazaki told stone-faced party attendees. “Once this trilogy is complete I can’t bear the thought of making another second of film.”</p>
<p>Miyazaki later told Whale-Line reporters that a fourth film was almost certain to happen as well.</p>
<p>Joe Hisaishi will score the pictures, which was a surprise to Hisaishi. He really thought they were done this time, the gullible old scamp.</p>

      <h2> Chelsea Clinton’s unborn child announces Senate run</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>The unborn child of Chelsea Clinton has confirmed its plans to run for the Rhode Island junior senate seat next year.</p>
<p>The announcement, delivered yesterday by Chelsea Clinton during a fundraising event on Long Island, received rapturous applause from attendees. Speculation had been rife since the child’s conception in May.</p>
<p>Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action has already raised $13 million for the candidate, although grassroots support is also strong.</p>
<p>The official campaign Twitter hashtag, #imwithwhateveritis, has been used seven times since the announcement.</p>
<p>Reactions have not been wholly positive. “This is another example of gross nepotism within the Democratic Party,” Ivanka Trump told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The foetus, touted by Nancy Pelosi as the bright young future of US politics, has yet to release any policy positions.</p>

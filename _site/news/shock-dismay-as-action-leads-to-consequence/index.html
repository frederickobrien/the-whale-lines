        <p>Millions are reeling - positively reeling - after <strong>[CONSEQUENCE]</strong> began to make itself felt following <strong>[ACTION]</strong>.</p>
<p>Countless experts had warned <strong>[ACTION]</strong> would almost certainly lead to <strong>[CONSEQUENCE]</strong>, citing various facts, figures, and historical precedents in the process, but their concerns were widely dismissed as elitist fear mongering.</p>
<p>Now, with <strong>[CONSEQUENCE]</strong> wreaking entirely predictable havoc, some are rationalising their complicity, with limited success.</p>
<p>“Who could have seen <strong>[CONSEQUENCE]</strong> coming?” said one popular radio personality. “It came out of nowhere. Anyone claiming they predicted it were probably behind it from the start. I for one blame <strong>[STRAW MAN]</strong>.”</p>
<p>Both <strong>[ACTION]</strong> and <strong>[CONSEQUENCE]</strong> hold vital lessons for the future, lessons you can bet your house on being widely ignored or otherwise avoided.</p>

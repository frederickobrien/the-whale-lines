      <h2>Nick Clegg hired as spokesperson for North Korea Tourism Agency</h2>

      

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>Former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg revealed today that he is leaving his role at Facebook in order to serve as chief spokesperson for the North Korea Tourism Agency.</p>
<p>The move marks the latest in an illustrious career of apologetics for Clegg, who made a tearful farewell outside Facebook’s headquarters in London before boarding a jet set for Pyongyang.</p>
<p>“There’s no question the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has made mistakes in the past,” Clegg said, “but having spoken with senior members of the government I am confident it can reinvent itself going forward and I’m excited to be part of that journey.”</p>
<p>Clegg’s salary is understood to be ₩18,473,738,592 (around £12 million) a year, with benefits including a cycle to work scheme and his very own labour camp.</p>
<p>Vince Cable was approached for comment but <em>Whale-Line</em> reporters were told he was napping.</p>

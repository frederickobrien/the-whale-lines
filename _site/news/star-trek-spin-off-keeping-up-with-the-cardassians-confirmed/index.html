        <p>A new <em>Star Trek</em> series focusing on the lives of a Cardassian family was announced by CBS today at a celebratory party in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The show, entitled <em>Keeping Up with the Cardassians</em>, will centre on the spoilt, self-involved children of Gul Dukat, a fan favourite character from Deep Space Nine.</p>
<p>CBS President Kelly Kahl, who attended the party, said: “Few franchises hold as many posibilities as Star Trek does. We’re delighted to be pushing the envelope with this new series.”</p>
<p>“Needless to say we’re very excited about the product placement potential of the show. I mean creative potential. Creative potential.”</p>
<p>Keeping Up with the Cardassians will take place on a starship called teh Goblar. Gul Dukat actor Marc Alaimo has been lured out of his retirement home to reprise his role. All other parts have been filled by various sons, daughters, nieces, and nephews of the producers.</p>

      <h2> COVID-19 LATEST: White House prescribes burying head in sand</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>The coronavirus could be on its last legs thanks to a new miracle cure unveiled by the US Government today: burying one’s head in the nearest available sand.</p>
<p>A painfully out of his depth President Trump revealed the new measures this afternoon during his daily press briefing. Two secret service bodyguards assisted pandemic advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, 79, in a demonstration of the technique until he stopped moving.</p>
<p>“See?” Trump said. “Calm. Very very calm. Limp as a fish. Have you seen anyone so calm in your life? Not me, and I’ve seen some calm folks let me tell you.” Etc.</p>
<p>World Health Organisation (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom quickly condemned the treatment as “offensively uscientific,” going on to gently suggest the United States get its act together before thousands - if not millions - of people die.</p>
<p>WHO has since been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization on account of violence against the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>

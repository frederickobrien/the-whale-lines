        <p>Legendary singer-songwriter Bob Dylan released an epic new song last night, its runtime clocking in at two years, three months, seven days, four hours, and two seconds long.</p>
<p>Supposedly recorded in one take, “The Long Goodbye” covers a range of subjects, including William Sherman’s scorched earth policy during the American Civil War, moon landing conspiracies, and recurring items on Dylan’s grocery shopping lists.</p>
<p>Reviews of the first day of the song have been largely positive - the NME gave it a groveling perfect score, as is tradition - though some have questioned whether this was really necessary.</p>

      <h2> Government runs perfectly after being sprayed with WD-40</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>UK democracy is running like a dream after it occurred to a Civil Service intern to try spraying it with the ever-reliable WD-40 spray.</p>
<p>Naysayers said that it wouldnâ€™t work, that the workings of government are too complex to be solved by a mere water-displacing mixture, but boy were they wrong.</p>
<p>As if by magic, the rusty, warped, outdated system of governance groaned into motion within seconds of being sprayed and soon enough was as good as new.</p>
<p>Other nations are now looking at giving themselves the same treatment, with swathes of both the public and private sector said to be placing bulk orders of their own.</p>
<p>For its part a freshly sprayed military-industrial complex is wasting no time preparing for territorial wars over WD-40 manufacturing locations.</p>

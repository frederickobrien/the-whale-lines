      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>That bloke at social gatherings whose sole personality trait appears to be performing card tricks finally pulled some tail this week.</p>
<p>The guy - you know the one - could scarcely believe it himself when an attractive young woman was not just impressed by his ability to guess the right card, but positively enthralled.</p>
<p>According to witnesses, the unlikely couple went into one of the apartment’s empty bedrooms and appeared several minutes later looking suitably ruffled up.</p>
<p>The young lady lost interest later that same night, but for the amateur magician it was a kind of deliverance after years of indulgence and silent judgement.</p>

      <h2> Jeremy Corbyn apologises for saying the road to Gulag was paved with good intentions</h2>

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>Labour leader Jeremby Corbyn issued a formal apology today for suggesting Soviet labour camps were well-meaning schemes gone awry.</p>
<p>Corbyn made the statements entirely unprompted when asked about nationalisation at a town hall meeting in Peterborough last week.</p>
<p>“It was not my intention to offend anyone or disparage the memories of millions of comrades who died at the hands of Soviet tyranny,” Corbyn said. “I mispoke. Again. I hope this statement put’s everyone’s minds at ease.”</p>
<p>He closed by saying the only for the country to move on from this was through a general election.</p>

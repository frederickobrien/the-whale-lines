      <h2> Relief as only normal porn found on pope’s hacked computer</h2>

      <p><strong>(<date> Wed Apr 15 2020 </date>)</strong></p>

      <p>The Catholic Church breathed a collective sigh of relief today after it was revealed Pope Francis’ hacked computer only contained run of the mill smut.</p>
<p>The religious leader’s most sensitive files were leaked to WikiLeaks last week and there had been much trepidation about just what kind of pornography he watched.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he’s a perfectly normal pervert. Indeed, many have found it rather charming that he downloaded such tame stuff at all given its reportedly widespread availability online. When The Whale-Lines went to print #ThePeoplesPope was the world’s top trending social media hashtag.</p>
<p>The pope’s favoured genre of porn is apparently - and predictably - naughty nuns. He had a whopping 12 terabytes of the stuff, all in glorious 4K.</p>
<p>An online directory of all the films, photographs, and fanfiction found on the harddrive has been set up at vaticantitties.com.</p>

      <h2>Obituary: Baxter</h2>

      

      <div class="story-copy">

        <p>Baxter the cat, 11, passed away last week after getting into an ill-judged fight with a fox. One of a litter of three, Baxter had been a fixture in the neighbourhood and was much loved by his family, though the feeling was not at all mutual. If anything Baxter felt deep disdain for his owners, seeing their unconditional, simpering love as a kind of weakness. He used humans for food and shelter and felt no affection for them, especially the children.</p>
